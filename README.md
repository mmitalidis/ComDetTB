# ComDetTB
Matlab toolbox for community detection (aka graph clustering) in Social Networks.

## Description
The Community Detection Toolbox (CDTB) contains several functions from the following categories. 

1. graph generators; 
2. clustering algorithms; 
3. cluster number selection functions; 
4. clustering evaluation functions.

Furthermore, CDTB is designed in a parametric manner so that the user can add his own functions and extensions.

The CDTB can be used in at least three ways. The user can employ the functions from the MATLAB command line; or he can write his own code, incorporating the CDTB functions; or he can use the Graphical User Interface (GUI) which automates the community detection and includes some data visualization options.
